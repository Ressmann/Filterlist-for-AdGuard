# Filterlist for AdGuard 2.2

![Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/Filterlist-for-AdGuard/master/Screenshots/Logo_AG.png)

An aggressive filter-list that consolidates over 80 lists for use in AdGuard Home (https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdguardHome).

* Blocks many ads, affiliates, analytics, enrichments, widgets and trackers
* Blocks crypto-locker, drug, fake, fake news, phishing, ransomware, scam, spam, suspicious, and typosquatting websites
* Includes the official **AdGuardSDNSFilter**
* The final blocklist is cleaned, sorted and then duplicates have been removed

_Please Note: The list is very aggressive so please ensure that you add your own "Custom filtering rules" for domains you want to allow.
e.g: @@||nexusmods.com^$important_

As of version 2.2 the list is more cleaned up, optimized and better than ever.

## News

* 2.3 is coming out soon, I'm testing it over the next 2 weeks.
* 2.2 is out. The major change is that going forward updates will be sporadic and less frequent.

This is since I've found no reasonable way to upload a file or commit to github on a schedule.

(For me it never remembers the authenication long enough)

## Usage 📐

Check that you are using __AdGuard Home v0.103.3__ or later (hotfixes vital functionality).

Once you have __AdGuard Home__ ready and are logged in, use its main menu to add one __blocklist__ and one __allowlist__.

### Filters Update Interval ⏱

You can modify how often filter lists are updated within Adguard Home in the __Settings__ > __General Settings__ page.

Set "Filters update interval" to 1 hour and click the green "Save" button. This list updates sporadically.

## Suggestions 📌

Do you have a new host list you'd like to suggest?

Please first check that the list does not already exist in : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hl2guide/Filterlist-for-AdGuard/master/filter_list_URLs.txt

Then create a new GitHub issue with the prefix "[add host list]" if it's new.

## Credits ☺️

Full credit for the actual blocking ability goes to original list creators and maintainers.

Thanks so much for their tireless work! :D
